>***What next?***

If you have reached this point,
it means you have done all *Intermediate + Beginner* Google Slides & exercises. 
<br></br>
The only thing left to do is to experiment with projects in real life, slowly adjusting to constant use of different sets of libraries, and finally fit right into the team! 
Most of the libraries, used in the robotics team, can be found in their repositories. 
<br></br>
One thing that might take prejudice is that you may need to understand some higher math, i.e intergrals, derivates, velocity curves. Another is the understanding of
Odometry, robot's position, and some PID moto control. If you may have any questions regarding these concepts, feel free to ask Mr. Kieff/Dr. Trepaigner.
